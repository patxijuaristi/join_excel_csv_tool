I have done it by connecting my Wordpress site to a Flask API located on a subdomain of my own, and creating a custom Wordpress plugin to do all this process and comunication.

## How to Run It in Local

To execute this script you need to run it in the command prompt.

```bash
unir_excels_juaristech.exe
```

Then, you will need to specify where you have stored the spreadsheets:

You can specify a complete path (*D:\Projects\spreadsheets\cars*) or if you have the spreadsheets in the same directory as the script, you can type "." or press enter without introducing nothing.

```bash
[1] Introduce the path to of sheets folder: 
```

Then the script starts to work, and when it finished, the output CSV file would appear in the folder. If you open the file in an editor, and the output is strange, you need to specify to set the text in columns to display the output correctly. For example in Excel, you will need to go to *Data -> Text in columns -> Delimited -> Tabulation -> Finish*. Take into account that the **delimiter is tabulation**.
